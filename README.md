# About
I have 2.6 years of experience as a DevOps Engineer and am currently working on a live project called NUXEO as a Development and Automation Engineer.

I have hands-on experience with configuration management, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes. My expertise includes containerization using Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, and cloud services like AWS and Azure. I have also implemented infrastructure as code (IaC) practices using tools like Ansible and Terraform.
